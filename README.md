## Welcome
If you made your way to this page it is probably because you found it from watching my YouTube video on my channel [Hex Blit University](https://youtube.com/c/hexblituniversity)

### Save and Load Empty Scene 
To get started just download the zip file.

Main and Save-and-load-00-no-save should be in the same state so feel free to download either branches. <br/><br/>

The other branches represents the results of what we are going to accomplish. So if you get stuck feel free to look at those branches and see what is diffferent from your implementation

If you run into any issues let me know!

Stay Safe, Stay Awesome!
